        <p class="text-xl text-justify"><span class="font-semibold">Different Ways to Select Elements in the DOM .</span><br>

            In JavaScript, there are multiple ways to select elements from the Document Object Model (DOM). Each method has its own advantages and use cases. Among them, my personal favorite and the most convenient one is getElementById(). However, there are several other methods as well.
            
            The getElementById(id) method selects a single element based on its unique id. This is one of the most efficient ways to access an element directly.
            
            The getElementsByClassName(className) method selects multiple elements that share the same class. It is useful when applying changes to a group of elements with a common class.
            
            The getElementsByTagName(tagName) method selects all elements of a specific tag type, such as div, p, or span. This is helpful when working with multiple elements of the same type.
            
            The querySelector(selector) method selects the first element that matches a given CSS selector. It allows for flexible selection using class names, IDs, or element types.
            
            The querySelectorAll(selector) method selects all elements that match a given CSS selector. It returns a NodeList, which</p>

        <p class="text-2xl py-3 font-bold">Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?</p>
        <p class="text-xl text-justify">Using the innerHTML property, we can dynamically add or remove HTML tags. Through this, you can add a new "p" tag, and by clicking a button, you can either add or remove any HTML tag.

            For example, by using innerHTML, you can add a new "p" tag and display it within the HTML document. Similarly, by clicking a button, you can remove or modify a specific HTML tag from the document.
            
            This provides a convenient way to dynamically change and control the content of an HTML document.</p>

        <p class="text-2xl py-3 font-bold">Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?</p>
        <p class="text-xl text-justify">Event delegation is a DOM technique that helps in dynamically controlling a website. It works by using event listeners, such as the event.target property, which is used to identify the element from which the event originated. Through this, you can easily manage events for multiple child elements by attaching a single event listener to a parent element.</p>

        <p class="text-2xl py-3 font-bold">Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?</p>
        <p class="text-xl text-justify">If you click on a button, and the button is inside a parent element, the click event will first occur on the button, and then it will bubble up to the parent element, its parent, and even the entire document. You can add an event listener to the parent element using event bubbling.</p>
